summary: An image-processing spreadsheet.
description: |
  nip2 is half-way between a spreadsheet and a paint program. 
  It's terrible for retouching photographs, but very handy for automating image 
  processing tasks. 

  It can process multi-gigabyte images efficiently. It has good support for 
  scientific image formats. It's much faster and more flexible than tools like 
  ImageJ. 

  This snap is git master nip2 built with git master libvips.
